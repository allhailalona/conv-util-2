stage 1: dropping files and rendering them:
  drop files/select them
  iterate through dropped folder/subfolders to create an array of objects:
    check file/folder
      if file:
        check format
          if format image/audio/video:  
            detail: check name, check type(already known), check duration
      if folder:
        detail: check name, check type(already known), check children
          if children: repeat the process on children.
  render them all in a table - 
    - indentation and arrows to subfolders
    - view file name, type and duration
    - remove button for folders n files

stage 2: possible side actions after render
  expand/collapse a/all dir/s on click
  clear a/all file/s  folder/s

stage 3: converting actions and aftermath
  pick an output dir 
  convert to constant files
  provide progress bar for each file and a total progress bar
  stop/pause controls
  view before and after size, and time elapsed 

stage 4: extra optional stuff
  info button to explain app and choice of formats
  nice styling
