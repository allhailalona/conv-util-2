For now I think the project is in an overal good condition. However, there are several minor and minute issues that can be addressed in the future:
- End FFMPEG Processes on app close as well
- Styling:
  - audio/video/image icons instead of folders
  - Close the distance between the icons and the actions
  - Standardize Buttons styling
= Fix the 2 loaded windows bug
- Fix the Dev Pane not always opening bug
- Don't load empty folders/files, instaed pop a 'no files found' notifcation
- Expand/ Collapse All functionality, perhaps auto expand all on files selection
- Info or tutorial modal on app start
- A before and after size modal after conversion
